## USAGE :hammer_and_pick:

To use this site for your own Mandy-powered site, you need to have Mandy installed. To find out how to do that, head over to [this link](https://angeldollface.art/mandys-house/documentation/installation). You also need to have [Git](https://git-scm.org) installed. Once you have both installed, you can use this in the following way:

```bash
mandy -v
```

- 2.) Clone this site's source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angeldollface/mandys-house
```

- 3.) Change into your site's root directory:

```bash
cd mysite
````

- 4.) Start the development server:

```bash
mandy -s .
```

- 5.) Open a browser window at the address that is output in the terminal session. Pretty rad, huh? :heart_on_fire:
