## ABOUT

Roughly one year ago, when I was just starting to learn Rust, I was re-building my main website and wondered which static-site generator to use for this re-building project. I had been using Jekyll up until that point but then heard rumours that Ruby (the language that Jekyll was written in) was declining very quickly in use and decided to write my own static-site generator in Rust. This project was called Acid. I used Acid for some time but then got bored and deleted it because there were too many problems with Acid. Recently, I got interested again in writing my own static-site generator after contributing a lot to the [Lume project](https://lume.land), a static-site generator based on the [Deno](https://deno.land) Javascript runtime. Since I now know much more about coding in Rust, I decided to revive Acid and make a new project based on Acid, called Mandy. This is that project. In case you do not know what a static-site generator is, here's a link that explains everything: [Read Me](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/static-site-generator/). This repository contains the source code for Mandy. I have big plans for her.
