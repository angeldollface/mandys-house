## ABOUT

Roughly two years ago, when I was just starting to learn Rust, I was re-building my main website and wondered which static-site generator to use for this re-building project. I had been using Jekyll up until that point but then heard rumours that Ruby (the language that Jekyll was written in) was declining very quickly in use. For this reason, I decided to write my own static-site generator in Rust. This project was called Acid. I used Acid for some time but then deleted it. Acid's code was unclean, error-reporting didn't really exist and I didn't really understand Rust's philosophy at the time.

Recently, I got interested again in writing my own static-site generator after contributing a lot to the [Lume project](https://lume.land), a static-site generator based on the [Deno](https://deno.land) Javascript runtime. Since I now know much more about coding in Rust now, I decided to revive Acid and make a new project based on Acid, called Mandy. This is that project. In case you do not know what a static-site generator is, here's a link that explains everything: [Read Me](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/static-site-generator/). This website is Mandy's home and project site. You will find everything related to Mandy here.
