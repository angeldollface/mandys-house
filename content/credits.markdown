## WHO MADE MANDY?

Mandy is a project by me, [angeldollface](https://github.com/angeldollface). I go by the name of "Angel Dollface" but my name is Alexander Abraham and I'm a developer from Vienna, Austria. I'm also a passionate Rustacean. I created Mandy in roughly two weeks and I'm still working on adding new features. If you'd like to contribute to the project, you are more than welcome to do so. Mandy's code can be found [here](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy). You can fork the repository, add a feature, and file a Pull Request or open an issue if you encounter problems or would like to suggest a new feature.
