## WHO MADE MANDY?

Mandy is a project by me, [angeldollface](https://github.com/angeldollface). I go by the name of "Angel Dollface" but my name is Alexander Abraham and I'm a little developer doll from Vienna, Austria. I'm also a passionate Rustacean. I created Mandy in roughly two weeks for a multitude of reasons. You can read about those on the "About" page.
