## PRETTY ICONS

Mandy's logo was made by me. I thought one could maybe embed Mandy's logo in different contexts for different things in Mandy-powered sites. For this reason, Mandy offers two icons: A dark one and a white one. To use them in your HTML code, you can add the following line:
The dark one: `<img src="https://angeldollface.art/doll-cdn/images/mandy/mandy-icon-black.svg"/>`
The white one: `<img src="https://angeldollface.art/doll-cdn/images/mandy/mandy-icon-white.svg"/>`
The icons are SVGs, so you don't need to worry about size or scaling.
