## USING LIQUID LAYOUTS

Mandy uses Liquid as the templating language for making and rendering layouts for content in a Mandy-powered site.

Generally in Liquid you output content using two curly braces e.g. `{{ variable }}` and perform logic statements by surrounding them in a curly brace percentage sign e.g. `{% if statement %}`. To learn more about Liquid, check out the official [Liquid Documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).
