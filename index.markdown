## NO DEPENDENCIES, NO DRAMA!

Mandy is written in Rust so it provides a single executable. You don't have to install anything except for Mandy herself.

## HYPERSONIC

Mandy is written in Rust. Your site will be compiled in <0.5s.

## EASY TO USE

If you're just interested in creating a basic site, there are template projects. Modify the content as text and you're off to the races. No coding knowledge required!

## DEPLOY LIKE A PRO

Mandy leverages GitHub Actions by providing a GitHub Action that will have your site running and available to the entire internet in minutes!

## USE THE TECHNOLOGIES YOU KNOW

Mandy uses SASS, Liquid, and JSON for styling, templating, and data storage. Developing a theme has never been this simple!
